SMModelObject is a very handy superclass for "Model Object" types.
It requires the 64-bit runtime, either iOS >4.0 or Snow Leopard, and LLVM Clang >=1.6.

Additionally, as of this writing, you'll need to add the compiler flags "-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2" in that exact
order if you don't want to have to write @synthesize yourself. This shouldn't be necessary after the official Clang 2.0 release. More info about that here:

Much, much credit given to Andr√© Pang and his phenomenal RMModelObject which was the inspiration for this class.
