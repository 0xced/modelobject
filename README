IMPORTANT NOTE

Apple has removed the "-objc-nonfragile-abi2" flag from the latest Xcode 4 DP6 release and have stated that,
although they continue to work on it, it will not be present in the GM release of Xcode 4.

This means that you can no longer omit the @synthesize from your classes, including SMModelObject.
Everything still works, you just need to write @synthesize on your own. I've updated the sample project to
reflect this.

If you want to pressure Apple to include this feature in the GM (which I've done), then please clone my rdar bug which I've
posted here:

Just log onto https://bugreport.apple.com/ and create your own copied version of my bug report above.
Apple reads EVERY bug report they receive and your cloned report will count as an extra vote for this feature.

SMModelObject is a very handy superclass for "Model Object" types.
It requires the 64-bit runtime, either iOS (any version) or Snow Leopard, and LLVM Clang >=1.6.

Additionally, as of this writing, you'll need to add the compiler flags "-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2" in that exact
order if you don't want to have to write @synthesize yourself. This shouldn't be necessary after the official Clang 2.0 release. More info about that here:

Much, much credit given to Andr√© Pang and his phenomenal RMModelObject which was the inspiration for this class.
